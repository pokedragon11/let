      <h1>💌 My Love Letter</h1>
      <p>
To my baby,<br><br>

If you’ve successfully opened this message—with Ed Sheeran’s <i>Perfect</i> playing in the background, a box of doughnuts for you and your family, and a tiny surprise close by—then I believe my one-month anniversary plan has gone perfectly, Alhamdulillah.<br><br>

I wanted to do something a little romantic, something different. You loved the last letter so much, so I thought: why not try a new version of it? This time, there's a physical element—the QR code in your hand. While it might pass through many hands, the message within it? That’s meant for just one person. The only person who holds the key. The key to my heart. <b>You</b>, my BABY.<br><br>

So sit back, take a bite of your doughnut, and read on as I pour my heart out to you on our one-month anniversary, Alhamdulillah.<br><br>

From the very first moment I spoke to you, just a month ago, I felt something I hadn’t felt before—a strange, soft “coming home” kind of feeling. Like this was written. Like I had been waiting my whole life, and then suddenly, <i>you</i>.<br><br>

You give me the emotional security I needed—the kind that makes life feel lighter, softer. The kind that makes all the hard days before you feel like they were leading me here, to <i>us</i>.<br><br>

And that moment at Loco, when I first held your hands… it just felt <i>right.</i> Like these were the hands I was meant to hold while I drive, while we talk, while we flirt. Hands I want to hold for the rest of my life, <b>In Sha Allah</b>.<br><br>

You make me feel loved in a way I’ve never felt before. You make me feel appreciated, understood, <i>seen</i>. There are moments where I just stop and think—how did I get so lucky? How did Allah bless me with someone like you, Alhamdulillah?<br><br>

Your messages still make my heart race. Your voice notes? They’re pure adrenaline. And your calls? Well, your calls set off every alarm in the best way possible—a rush of joy every single time.<br><br>

You are, without a doubt, one of the strongest people I’ve ever met—emotionally, mentally, spiritually. And for all the months to come <b>In Sha Allah</b>, for all the years ahead <b>In Sha Allah</b>, I just want to spend them making you laugh, feel loved, feel heard, feel seen—and most of all, <i>feel happy</i>.<br><br>

I want to make you so happy, to the point where you can’t stop smiling and giggling. I want to love you in a way that makes every old sadness melt away. I want you to know, deep in your heart, that I’m not going anywhere—<b>In Sha Allah</b>. So don’t doubt that for even a second.<br><br>

Thank you for making these 2,630,016 seconds—this one month—the absolute best in all of the 9,675 days I’ve been alive.<br><br>

I love you.<br><br>

Your Baby
